# mini-c-ares

A fork of [rust-c-ares](https://github.com/dimbleby/rust-c-ares), which provides
a minimal Rust wrapper for the [`c-ares`](https://c-ares.org/) library, for
asynchronous DNS requests.

Most users should likely prefer
[`c-ares-resolver`](https://github.com/dimbleby/c-ares-resolver/), which offers
a much simpler API and more functionality.

## Documentation
